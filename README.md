# Frontend Mentor - QR Code Component

This is my solution to the [QR Code Component challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_s5Ck1) on Frontend Mentor. The challenge involves creating a simple, responsive QR code component that displays a QR code with a short message and can be used in any web application.

## Overview

- **Challenge**: Build a responsive QR code component that displays a QR code image with a heading and description.
- **Objective**: Use HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript to replicate the design provided and make it responsive.
- **Tech Stack**: HTML, and CSS (Flexbox for layout).


## Features

- A simple, clean, and responsive design.
- Displays a QR code with a heading and a short description.
- Mobile-friendly layout (using Flexbox).
- Accessible and semantic HTML structure.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KennethPlumstead/qr-code-component.git
   cd qr-code-component
2.	**Open index.html in your browser**:

  	You can open the index.html file directly in your browser to view the component.
    Alternatively, if you have a local server setup (using something like Live Server in VS Code), you can view the site that way.

## Technologies Used

	•	HTML5 for structure.
	•	CSS3 for styling (Flexbox for layout).
	•	Responsive Design: Uses media queries to ensure the design is mobile-friendly.

## Challenges Faced

	•	Ensuring the design is responsive across different screen sizes. This was accomplished using Flexbox for layout and CSS media queries.
	•	Ensuring proper alignment and spacing within the container to keep the design clean and simple.
	•	Handling the image and text responsiveness, particularly making sure the QR code scales correctly across devices.

Result

The QR code component is now responsive and adjusts based on the screen size. It displays the QR code image and has a clear description. It also meets all the requirements specified in the challenge. The solution provides a simple, visually appealing component that works seamlessly across different devices.
